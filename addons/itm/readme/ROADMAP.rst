* Manually set (or install) the python library 'cryptography' to version 36.0.2. Because of Odoo Python requirements this module will **NOT** work with versions of cryptography greater than 36.0.2. It will also **NOT** work with the version in the Odoo requirements.txt file (currently 3.4.8).
* The password for encrypting and decrypting credentials is stored in Odoo as a system parameter. An attacker who has the 'Administration/Settings' priviledge or has access to the Odoo database itself can easily decrypt a credential's password field.
* To Do: store the encryption password in Odoo's configuration file instead of a system parameter in the database
